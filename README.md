# A-way-to-segment-your-customers

The company found out that the previous segmentation of the consumer market, grouped by geography, is not suitable for improving their marketing service. It does not display the actual picture, since there may be 1 doctor with more than 100 purchases in the region, or 7 doctors with 4 purchases. Therefore, the region is not a good predictor of the number of purchases that a doctor will make or his support needs. The company turned to us for help to build a new segmentation of doctors based on the company's data in order to improve marketing, customer service and product planning.

All the technical side will be described consistently in the course of the work. Now let's talk about the result and what characteristics distinguish the new segments.
